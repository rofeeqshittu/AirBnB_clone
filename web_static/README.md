# AirBnB Clone - Web Static

## Project Summary

The **AirBnB Clone - Web Static** project is part of the ongoing development of the AirBnB clone. It involves creating the front-end static pages of the AirBnB application using HTML and CSS. The goal is to design a simple user interface without using JavaScript or loading any data from external sources. The project builds a foundation for future enhancements, like adding dynamic behavior with JavaScript and connecting to a backend.

This project contains structuring web pages using HTML, apply styles with CSS, and follow best practices for front-end development. This is the first step in developing a more complex web application.
